####Musician Turned Programmer

I moved to Seattle almost a year ago from Columbus Ohio. I am a graduate of The Ohio State University with a degree in Jazz Performance specializing in the drum set. I have been teaching drum and piano lessons, accompanying dance classes and playing gigs since I graduated in 2010. You can check out my website [here](www.dzwellingmusic.com)

I'm psyched to get deeper into Python and take my coding to the next level.
